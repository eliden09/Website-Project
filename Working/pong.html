        <h2>Modified Pong</h2>
        <p>This JavaScript program that uses P5Editor was made back during my Fall 2021 Semester in my Computing Principals class.</p>
        <p>What I did was use a pong program that was already made and functional as a reference to make a slightly modified version of the game.</p>
        <p>Now instead of just being responsible for the left and right side of the screen, you must also protect the top and bottom as well.</p>
