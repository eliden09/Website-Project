The purpose of this website was to try and better advertise an at home project I was starting

The project involved the collection, maintanence, and sale of second-hand computers and components.
I was also going to offer maintanence and custom build consults as well, marketting myself as a form of tech support.

The websites shows some work I've done in previous classes, computers I was working on at home, and anything else I felt important to demonstrate
somewhat decent capabilities with technology.

The idea was to provide a competitive pricing on the market. A cheap, afforadable(yet profitable) alternative to places such as Walmart, Best Buy, etc.
