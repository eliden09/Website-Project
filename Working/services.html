    <dt>Computer Maintenance and Repair</dt>
        <dd>Is the family computer running a little slow? Is your gaming computer not using all of its RAM or running a little hot? If your computer is having any kind of trouble, let me come down and take a look at it. Whether it be a simple software/hardware issue or the failure of a critical component, I'll do my best to find out what's wrong and what needss to be done to fix it.</dd>
    <dt>Custom Build Assistance</dt>
        <dd>Whether you need help finding the right parts to put into your computer or putting it together, I'd be happy to come lend a hand and help give you a little more peace of mind. Building computers, especially for the first time, can be a little intimidating. Let me help you work past that.</dd>
    <dt>Resale of Used Components/Computers</dt>
        <dd>To learn more about the hardware and software of computers I'm collecting old and used machines to repair and refurbish for resale. I'll make sure they are reliable and able to run before ever marketting them as usable machines.</dd>
