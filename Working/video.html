        <h2>Freelance Video Project</h2>
        <p>For some time I wanted to try and be a YouTuber. Always had thoughts of creating either gaming videos or intense gaming music montages.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, while I was amazing at putting ideas together in my head, there was never an execution of a plan.</p>
        <p>One day I finally buckled down and created a video I had thought out in my head. Thus, this little creation of mine was born.</p>
        <p>Feb 9, 2021 is the day I posted this video. It was the first video that really took some work. I believe it was about 8 hours of putting it all together.</p>
