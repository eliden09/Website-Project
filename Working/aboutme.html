<p>My name is Eli Heffernan. I am a college student in my 20's working on a bachelors in Computer Systems as well as an associates in Web Design. The website you are currently looking at is one I made from scratch by myself using Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>My current experience in the tech field is primarily personal experience and self-taught information. During the production of this website, I am in my first year of the Computer Systems degree program and learning more on the software side of computers. Please do not confuse me being self-taught for being inefficient, I do my work exceptionally well even if it takes me popping open a laptop and scanning the internet for more information. I make sure to know what it is I'm doing before I do it, ensuring that I make as few mistakes as possible. I can't guaruntee perfection, but I will do my best to ensure a solution is found.</p>
<p>I started this project primarily because I really like computers. But due to the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, not being secure enough financially to purchase parts at will, and supply shortages rocking the computer industry in 2021, I am very slow on getting the project started.</p>
